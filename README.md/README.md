# Background 
    * TrainerTrack is an app designed for running enthusiasts like myself! 
    * Running has seen a huge uptake in recent years, inspiring rapid development in the technology and equipment within the sport. 
    * As a long-distance runner, comfortable trainers are the most important thing to me and discussing these with other runners led to the idea for this app. 
    * This app enables users to access more information and data on their trainers to support their goals. 
    * Community is one of my most enjoyable parts of running and makes it one of the best sports out there; it's open to everyone regardless of factors such as age, ability, location etc. 
    * The website and theme itself is inspired by current fitness apps and sites which evoke movement, darker palettes and scientific layouts such as Strava, Runna and the Nike After Dark tour page. 
    * The logo is both an 8 and an infinity symbol; 8 because there are 8 x lanes in a running track and infinity because there is limitless potential in running. 
    * It ties up the ethos of TrainerTrack: whatever lane you're running in, there's a trainer for you and a community to join! 

# App Functionality 
    * All users have the opportunity to view the trainer index (this is a library of all trainers which have been added to the app). 
    * Users can create accounts and join the community where you can build up a profile. 
    * User's profiles include trainers they have or are using, and details of these including their model, brand, price, terrain type and a rating. 
    * Users can interact with other runners in the community by favouriting trainers. 

# Next steps / Planned Enhancements
    * The community aspect of this app has potential to be developed further with threads and comments so users can interact further with one another. 
    * Adapting for various screen types using media queries would be essential for optimal user experience. 
    * Adapt colours to meet WCAG 2.0 level AA standards.
